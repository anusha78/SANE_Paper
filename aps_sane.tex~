The ratio of the electric and magnetic form factor of the proton,
$\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ has been measured for elastic electron-proton
scattering with polarized beam and target up to four-momentum transfer
squared, $Q^2=5.66$ (GeV/c)$^2$ using the double spin asymmetry for
target spin orientation aligned parallel and nearly perpendicular to
the beam momentum direction.  
%They are functions of the four-momentum transfer squared $Q^2$
%between the electron and the proton.  
%The form factors, $G_E$ and $G_M$ are experimentally accessible
%through \emph{Rosenbluth separation method} and
%\emph{double-polarization observables}. Both methods are sensitive to
%the form factors in different ways. There are two classes of
%double-polarization observables, the \emph{polarization-transfer
%method} and the \emph{double spin asymmetry} which has the same
%sensitivity to the form factor ratio as the first
%class. polarization-transfer method offer superior sensitivity to the
%electric form factor at higher $Q^2$. However, double spin asymmetry
%experiments were not carried out as the Rosenbluth or
%polarization-transfer experiments.  
%This paper reports the results of a new measurement of the ratio of
%the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton up to $Q^2=5.66$
%(GeV/c)$^2$ using the double spin asymmetry with a polarized beam and
%target. 

%Experiment E07-003 (SANE, Spin Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment)
%was carried out in Hall C at Jefferson Lab in 2009 to study the
%proton spin structure functions with a dynamically polarized ammonia
%target and longitudinally polarized electron beam. By detecting
%elastically scattered protons in the High-Momentum Spectrometer (HMS)
%in coincidence with the electrons in the Big Electron Telescope Array
%(BETA), elastic measurements were carried out in parallel. The
%elastic double spin asymmetry allows one to extract the proton
%electric to magnetic form factor ratio $G_E^p/G_M^p$ at high-momentum
%transfer, $Q^2=5.66$ (GeV/c)$^2$. In addition to the coincidence
%data, inclusively scattered electrons from the polarized ammonia
%target were detected by HMS, which allows to measure the beam-target
%asymmetry in the elastic region with the target spin nearly
%perpendicular to the momentum transfer, and to extract $G_E^p/G_M^p$
%at low $Q^2=2.06$ (GeV/c)$^2$.  

This measurement of $\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ agrees with $Q^2$ dependence
of previous recoil polarization data and reconfirms the %dramatic
discrepancy at high $Q^2$ between the Rosenbluth and the
polarization-transfer method with a different measurement technique
and systematic uncertainties uncorrelated to those of the
recoil-polarization measurements. The  form factor ratio at $Q^2$=2.06
(GeV/c)$^2$ has been measured as $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p = 0.720 \pm 0.176_{stat} \pm 0.039_{sys}$ which is in agreement
with an earlier measurement with the polarized target technique at
similar kinematics. At $Q^2$=5.66 (GeV/c)$^2$, the form factor ratio
has been determined as $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p=0.244\pm0.353_{stat}\pm0.013_{sys}$ which represents the
highest $Q^2$ reach with the double spin asymmetry to date.

The elastic form factors are fundamental properties of the nucleon
representing the effect of its structure on the response to
electromagnetic probes such as electrons.  %Therefore, 
Detailed
knowledge of the nucleon form factors is very important to understand
the nucleus. Electron scattering is an excellent tool to probe deep
inside nucleons and nuclei. In the one-photon exchange (Born)
approximation, the structure of the proton or neutron is characterized
by the electric and magnetic (Sachs) form factors $G_E (Q^2 )$ and
$G_M (Q^2 )$, which depend only on the four-momentum transfer squared,
$Q^2$. At $Q^2=0$, the proton form factors are normalized to the
charge $G_E^p(0)=1$ (in units of $e$) and the magnetic moment 
$G_M^p(0)=\mu_p=2.79$ (in units of nuclear magnetons).

The Rosenbluth separation technique has been the first method to
separate the squares of the proton form factors $G_E^p$ and $G_M^p$ by
measuring the unpolarized
elastic electron scattering cross sections at different
angles and energies at fixed $Q^2$ \cite{rosenbluth1950}. 
In addition,
the proton form factor ratio, $\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ has been extracted
from measurements of polarization components of the proton recoiling
from the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons \cite{157, 160}
%  158, 159}. 
In the ratio of polarization components, which is
proportional to $G_E^p/G_M^p$, many of the experimental systematic
errors are canceled.  

Measurement of the beam-target asymmetry using double polarization
experiments with polarized target is a third technique to extract
$\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$, which has not been conducted as often as
Rosenbluth separation or recoil polarization experiments
\cite{158,156}. For elastic scattering of polarized electrons from a
polarized target, the beam-target double asymmetry, $A_p$ is directly
related to the form factor ratio, $G_E^p/G_M^p$ as; 
\begin {equation}
%\begin {aligned}
\label {asym}
A_p=\frac{-bR\sin\theta^*\cos\phi^*-a\cos\theta^*}{R^2+c},
%\end {aligned}
\end {equation}
where $R=G_E^p/G_M^p$ with %$R = 1/\mu_p = 1/2.79$ at $Q^2=0$. 
$R = 1/2.79$ at $Q^2=0$. 
The polar and azimuthal angles, $\theta^*$ and $\phi^*$ relative to
the $z$ and $x$ axes, respectively, describe the
orientation of the proton polarization vector relative to the
direction of momentum 
transfer, $\vec{q} = \vec{p}_e - \vec{p}_{e'}$, where the $z$ axis
points along $\vec{q}$, the $y$ axis perpendicular to the
scattering plane defined by the electron three-momenta ($\vec{p}_e
\times \vec{p}_{e'}$), and the $x$ axis so to form a right-handed
coordinate frame. The quantities $a,b,c$ are kinematic factors given by
$a=2\tau\tan\frac{\theta_e}{2}\sqrt{1+\tau+(1+\tau)^2\tan^2\frac{\theta_e}{2}}$,
$b=2\tan\frac{\theta_e}{2}\sqrt{\tau(1+\tau)}$ and
$c=\tau+2\tau(1+\tau)\tan^2\frac{\theta_e}{2}$ with $\tau=
Q^2/(4M^2)$, where $\theta_e$ is the electron scattering angle and $M$
is the proton mass.% \cite{156}.

from double polarization experiments with recoil polarization
\cite{43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58}
% 57, 58}
and polarized target \cite{59,60}. An almost linear fall-off of the
polarization data can be seen compared to the nearly flat $Q^2$
dependence of $\mu_pG_E^p/G_M^p$ measured with the Rosenbluth
technique. One possible solution that explains the difference between
the polarized and unpolarized methods is two-photon exchange (TPE) \cite{97,
 98, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91, 90, 89}, which mostly affects the
Rosenbluth data while the correction of the polarization data is
small. It is also argued that other effects than TPE are
responsible for the discrepancy \cite{Kondratyuk:2005kk, Kuraev:2007dn,
Pacetti:2016}.
Several experiments have been conducted to validate the TPE hypothesis
by probing the angular dependence of recoil polarization~\cite{43}, nonlinear
dependence of unpolarized cross sections on $\epsilon$~\cite{163},
and by
directly comparing $e^+p$ and $e^-p$ elastic scattering~\cite{154,161,162,155}.
Evidence for TPE at $Q^2 < 2.5$ (GeV/c)$^2$ has been found to be smaller than 
expected, and more data is needed at high $Q^2$ to be conclusive~\cite{155}.

Having formally the equivalent sensitivity as the recoil polarization
technique to the form factor ratio, the third technique,  beam-target
asymmetry, is very well suited to verify the results of the recoil
polarization technique. By measuring $\mu_pG_E^p/G_M^p$ and comparing
it to the previous results, the discovery of any unknown or
underestimated systematic errors in the previous polarization
measurements is possible. The first such measurement was done by the
experiment RSS at Jefferson Lab at $Q^2=1.5$ (GeV/c)$^2$
\cite{60}. Carrying out the same measurement at higher $Q^2$ values is
very important to study the consistency of the third technique,
double-spin asymmetry with the first two techniques, Rosenbluth
separation and recoil polarization. In this work, the polarized target
method has been applied at $Q^2$ = 2.06 and 5.66 (GeV/c)$^2$

\section{Experimental Setup}

The experiment SANE (E07-003) is a single-arm inclusive-scattering
experiment \cite{109, 144, 142, 143, 139, 140}. The goal of SANE was
to measure the proton spin structure functions $g_1(x, Q^2)$ and
$g_2(x, Q^2)$ at four-momentum transfer squared 
%2.5$\textless Q^2 \textless$6.5 (GeV/c)$^2$ 
$2.5 < Q^2 < 6.5$ (GeV/c)$^2$ 
and values of the Bjorken scaling variable
%0.3$ \textless $x$ \textless$0.8, 
$0.3<x<0.8$, 
which is an extension of the
kinematic coverage of experiment RSS performed in Hall C, Jefferson
Lab \cite{179}.  
 

SANE measured the inclusive double spin asymmetries with the target
spin aligned parallel and nearly perpendicular ($\approx$80$^{\circ}$)
to the beam direction for longitudinally polarized electron scattering
from a polarized target~\cite{SANE2017}. 
%Dynamically Nuclear Polarized (DNP) proton target in form of
%crystallized ammonia (NH$_3$) \cite{136, 137}.  
The experiment was carried out in the experimental Hall C at Jefferson
Lab from January to March, 2009. A subset of the data was used to
measure the beam-target spin asymmetry from elastic electron-proton
scattering. 
%Polarized electrons with energies 4.72 GeV and 5.89 GeV
%were scattered from the polarized proton target with the spin of the
%proton aligned nearly perpendicular ($\approx$80$^{\circ}$) to the
%beam direction.  
Recoiled protons were detected by the High-Momentum Spectrometer (HMS)
at $22.3^{\circ}$ and $22.0^{\circ}$, and central momenta of 3.58 and
4.17 GeV/c, respectively, for the two different beam
energies. Scattered electrons were detected by the Big Electron
Telescope Array (BETA) in coincidence with the protons in the HMS.  
In addition to that configuration, single-arm electron scattering data
were also taken by detecting the elastically scattered electrons in the
HMS at a central angle of 15.4$^{\circ}$ and a central momentum of 4.4
GeV/c for an electron beam energy of 5.89 GeV for both target spin
configurations
%, spin perpendicular and parallel to the beam
%direction. 

The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility delivered longitudinally
polarized electron beams of up to 6 GeV with $\sim100$ \% duty factor 
simultaneously to the three experimental halls A, B, and C~\cite{100}. 
%More information about the CEBAF accelerator can be found in \cite{100}. 
The CEBAF accelerator has recently been upgraded to 12 GeV with the addition
of a fourth hall (D)~\cite{12GeV}. The Hall C arc dipole magnets
were used as a spectrometer to measure the energy of the electron beam
as it entered the Hall. Using the curvature of the beam over its
34.4$^{\circ}$ deflection by dipoles and the precise knowledge of the
arc dipole fields, the energy of the beam entered to the hall is
determined with an accuracy of $\Delta E/E\sim 10^{-4}$. The beam
polarization was measured with the Hall C M$\o$ller polarimeter
\cite{104} and was obtained to be nearly 85\% with a quantum efficiency
of 1\%. The fast-raster system with a uniform square beam spot of
$1\times1$ mm$^2$ \cite{101, 102}, 25 meters upstream of the target is
designed to increase the effective beam size in order to prevent
damage to the targets due to the high current and very localized
energy deposit.  

 
%Polarized electrons are emitted by illuminating Gallium Arsenide
%(GaAs) cathode using a circularly polarized laser light with a
%frequency equal to the energy of the band gap of the
%material. Jefferson Lab's polarized source uses a superlattice GaAs
%photocathode, in which the pure GaAs is doped by phosphorous, which
%delivers an 85\% polarized electron beam with quantum efficiency of
%1\%.  The orientation of the beam polarization is rotated by a Wien
%filter before injection into the accelerator to optimize the delivery
%of longitiudinal polarization to the experimental halls. The
%photo-emitted electrons are accelerated upto 67 MeV by the injector
%before entering to the CEBAF linacs. The electron acceleration takes
%place in superconducting RF-resonant Niobium cavities cooled by super
%fluid Helium at $\simeq$2 K, giving the maximum energy of
%approximately 6 GeV. More information about the CEBAF accelerator can
%be found in \cite{100}. 
%The beam is rastered to increase its spot size, which spreads the
%heat load over a wider area of the target.  
%The Hall C Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) monitor the beam position
%continously \cite{103}.  

In addition to the standard Hall C beam-line instrumentation, SANE
required extra beamline equipment to accommodate a polarized
target. A slow-raster system was added to spread the beam over an even
larger area of the target material. This second raster was circular,
with a diameter of 2 cm \cite{105}. Because the raster system rapidly
changed the actual beam position on the target during the experiment,
SANE monitored the beam position relative to the beam center by
recording the raster X and Y amplitudes. The target polarization was
maintained and oriented with a strong magnetic field. When the target
magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the beam, the electron beam
would be deflected down, away from the target center. To counteract
this, the beam was sent through a chicane of magnets which bent it
down and then back upward at the target so that it does not miss the
center of the target. Even after the beam passed through the target
center, it would continue to bend downwards, deflecting away from the
standard beam dump in the Hall. Therefore, an 80-foot-long helium bag
was used as the beam line from the scattering chamber to the beam
dump. The exit windows of this beam line were large enough to accept
the different beam deflections 2.8$^{\circ}$ and 2.2$^{\circ}$ due to
different beam energies 4.72 and 5.89 GeV, respectively. 

The primary apparatus for the elastic data was based on the
superconducting High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS), which has a large
solid angle and momentum acceptance, providing the capability of
analyzing high momentum particles up to 7.4 GeV/c. The spectrometer is
equipped with a set of detectors to register and track charged
particles scattered from the target. In the standard configuration,
the HMS detector package consists of a pair of gas drift chambers 
(DC1 and DC2)
\cite{107}, four planes of scintillator hodoscopes (S1X, S1Y, S2X,
S2Y) \cite{108}, a gas Cherenkov detector, and a lead-glass
calorimeter. The two drift chambers provide the particle tracking
information at the focal plane which is an imaginary plane defined in
the middle between the two drift chambers. The scintillator hodoscopes are
used for triggering the detector read-out and provide timing
information while the gas Cherenkov detector and the lead-glass
calorimeter provide information for particle identification (PID).  

In order to perform a coincidence experiment with the proton detected
in HMS, the electron detector required to have a large acceptance to
match with the proton acceptance defined by the HMS collimator. The
lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter, BigCal as a part of BETA,
provided the needed acceptance with enough energy and angular
resolution. The calorimeter was assembled by the GEp-III collaboration
\cite{44, 43}. 
% It consisted of 1744 type TF1-0 lead-glass bars with an total area
% of roughly 122$\times$218 cm$^2$. 
This has a large solid angle of approximately 0.2 sr with the face of
the calorimeter placed 3.50 m from the target cell. %\cite{106}. 
In addition to BigCal, BETA consists of Cherenkov counters and scintillating 
fiber trackers for particle identification (PID) and directional information.  
%BigCal with additional detectors including Cherenkov and Scintillator
%trackers, called "BETA" was used for the electron detection in
%coincidence data.

%The liquid helium evaporation refrigerator system kept the target
%material at 1 K temperature and 
 As a double polarization experiment, SANE used a polarized proton
 target in form of crystalized ammonia (NH$_3$). The protons in the
 NH$_3$ molecules were polarized using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization
 (DNP)  \cite{136, 137, 138}. The SANE polarized target setup 
%was operated by the University of Virginia target group. It 
replaced the standard Hall C
scattering chamber. The target system consisted of a  target
insert, a superconducting pair of Helmholtz magnets, a liquid helium
evaporation refrigerator system and a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) system. 
The target insert was roughly 2 m long which provided room for four
different containers of target materials, in 2.5 cm diameter cups. Two
cups called \emph{top} and \emph{bottom} were filled with crystalized
NH$_3$ beads which were used as the proton targets. In addition to the
crystalized ammonia, $^{12}$C and Polyethylene (CH$_2$) targets were
also used for detector calibration purposes.  
The target insert was immersed in a liquid He bath to maintain the
target material at 1~K temperature, which was cooled down from 4~K by
pumping off the liquid from the evaporation refrigerator in order to
optimize the target polarization. The superconducting pair of
Helmholtz magnets provided 5~T magnetic field in the target region. It
can be rotated around the target in order to change the target field
direction and hence the target polarization direction.  
%The NMR system provided an online target polarization and recorded
%the operating conditions.  

 
%In DNP, polarization transfers between electrons and nuclei can occur
%spontaneously through electron-nuclear cross relaxation and/or
%spin-state mixing among electrons and nuclei.  The Zeeman splitting
%between the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and NMR spins due
%to the high magnetic field and low temperature, double spin
%transitions are induced by microwave radiation. 

%These spin transitions, both electron and nucleon spin flips, are
%forbidden due to the dipole selection rules. Therefore, these
%transitions are induced by microwave radiation at high magnetic field
%and low temperature.  
%In order to form the free, unpaired electrons to use in DNP, ammonia
%beads were ionized to knock out an atomic hydrogen from NH$_3$
%molecules to form $dot{N}$H$_2$ paramagnetic centers.  
%Because of the strong interaction with the lattice, the electrons
%reach thermal equilibrium very rapidly (in 10$^{-3}$ S) by relaxation
%to the lowest energy state, allowing it to flip the spin of another
%proton. However, due to the weak coupling to the lattice, the
%relaxation time of the nucleons is much larger, $\sim$10$^3$ S. In
%this way, proton polarizations can be accumulated.  

The spin direction of the polarized proton can be aligned parallel
(positive polarization) or anti-parallel (negative polarization) to
the applied field direction by changing the frequency of the
microwave radiation. The microwave horns were used on each NH$_3$
target cup for this purpose. Data was taken at both microwave
frequencies. The NMR coils embedded into the NH$_3$ target cups
provided an online target polarization and recorded the operating
conditions. More details on the operation of the target can be found
in Ref.~\cite{109}. 
% James Maxwell's thesis \cite{109}. 
%both positive and negative polarizations can be achieved with the
%same magnetic field by altering the microwave frequency.  
%The positive polarization was reached by applying the microwave

The beam-target asymmetry, $A_p$ shown in Eq.~(\ref{asym}) is maximal
when the proton spin is aligned perpendicular to the four-momentum
transfer direction. However, due to a constraint on the rotation of the
Helmholtz magnets, the maximum spin direction one could reach was
80$^{\circ}$ without blocking the BETA acceptance. 


\section{Data Analysis}

Standard calibrations for all of the HMS detector components have been
performed \cite{110}. In addition, a large number of $\pi^0$ events
were produced in the target. These neutral pions decayed very rapidly
into two photons. The BigCal energy calibration was done using the
energy deposited in two separate clusters in BigCal from these two
photons from $\pi^0$ decay. More details of the BigCal calibration
method and procedure can be found in appendix D in Ref.~\cite{139}.
%A. Armstrong's thesis \cite{139}.  


The determination of the particle trajectory and momentum at the
target using the HMS was done in two major steps. The first
step was to find the trajectory, the positions and angles, $X_{fp}$
and $\theta_{fp}$ ($Y_{fp}$ and $\phi_{fp}$) in the dispersive
(non-dispersive) direction at the detector focal plane using the two
HMS drift chambers.  
%The focal plane is an imaginary plane defined in the middle between
%two drift chambers.  

The second step was to reconstruct the target quantities by mapping the
focal plane coordinates to the target plane coordinates using a
reconstruction matrix which represents the HMS spectrometer optics based
on a COSY model \cite{147}. 
The reconstructed target quantities are $Y_{tar}$, $\phi_{tar}$,
$\theta_{tar}$ and $\delta$, where $Y_{tar}$ is the horizontal position
at the target plane perpendicular to the central spectrometer ray,
$\theta_{tar}$ and $\phi_{tar}$ are the in-plane (non-dispersive) and 
out-of-plane (dispersive) scattering angles relative to the central ray. 
The HMS relative momentum parameter, $\delta = (P-P_0)/P_0$, where 
$P_0$ is the central momentum of the HMS, determines the momentum $P$ of 
the detected particle.

\subsection{Elastic Event Selection}
Single-arm electrons were identified in HMS with PID and momentum
acceptance cuts. The Cherenkov and the lead glass calorimeter in HMS
were used to discriminate $e^-$ from $\pi^-$, requiring the number of
photoelectrons seen by the Cherenkov counter $N_{cer} > 2$
(Cherenkov cut) and the relative energy deposited in the lead glass
calorimeter, $E_{cal}/P > 0.7$ (calorimeter cut),
 %and the energy deposited in the lead glass calorimeter, $E_{cal}$,
 %with respect to the detected electron momentum measured by the HMS
 %spectrometer, P, $E_{cal}/P\textgreater0.7$, (calorimeter cut), 
%the background due to $\pi^-$ particles.

The invariant mass, $W$ of the elastic $ep$ scattering can be written as
a function of the scattered electron momentum, $P$, angle, ${\theta_{e}}$
and beam energy, $E$ as  
\begin{equation}
\label{W}
W(P, \theta_e) = M^2 +2M(E-P) - 4 E P \sin^2{\theta_e}/2.
\end{equation}
%where $E$ is the incoming electron energy and $M_p$ is the proton
%mass. 
Figure~\ref{dccalib} shows the relative momentum
$\delta$ for the single-arm electron data as a function of invariant
mass, $W$.  
The nominal momentum acceptance is given by $-8\% < \delta
< 10\%$, which is usually applied as a fiducial cut in
addition to the PID cuts. This eliminates events that are outside of
the nominal spectrometer acceptance, but end up in the detectors after
multiple scattering in the magnets or exit windows. Because a
significant number of elastic events populated the region of larger
$\delta$ values as, $10\% < \delta < 12\%$, where the
reconstruction matrix elements are not well known, these data were
analyzed individually so that the systematic effect from the HMS
reconstruction matrix could be determined separately. Therefore, two
$\delta$ regions, $-8\% < \delta < 10\%$ and $10\% < \delta < 12\%$, 
were used separately in addition to
the PID cuts to extract the elastic events. About $\sim40\%$ of extra
elastic events were obtained by using this higher $\delta$ region.  

The elastic events from the coincidence data were selected using both 
HMS and BigCal quantities.  
The horizontal (vertical) coordinate of the scattered electron at the entrance
plane of BigCal, $X_{BETA}$  ($Y_{BETA}$) was measured, and also calculated
from the proton coordinates reconstructed by HMS, $X_{HMS}$ ($Y_{HMS}$) using 
elastic kinematics for the known electron beam energy, $E$ and the
recoil proton angle, $\theta_p$. The recoil proton momentum $P_p$ was
not used for the kinematic calculation because of its larger
uncertainty. An elliptic cut was applied to the differences, $\Delta Y =
(Y_{HMS}-Y_{BETA})$, and $\Delta X = (X_{HMS}-X_{BETA})$, 
\[
\left(\frac{\Delta X}{X_{cut}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\Delta
      Y}{Y_{cut}}\right)^2 \le 1. \] 
with $X_{cut}$ and $Y_{cut}$ representing the half axes,
to reduce the backgrounds most effectively as illustrated
in Fig.~\ref{xydiff}.  Here, $(X_{cut}, Y_{cut}) = (7, 10)$ cm. 

Based on energy and momentum conservation for electron-proton elastic
scattering,  the recoil proton momentum, $P_p(\theta_p)$ could
be calculated from the recoil proton angle, $\theta_p$, as
\begin{equation} 
\label{pp}
P_p(\theta_p)=\frac{2 M E(E + M) \cos
  {\theta_p}}{M^2+2 M E + E^2 \sin^2{\theta_p}}. 
\end{equation}
The residual difference between the proton momentum detected by HMS, $P_p$ 
and the proton momentum calculated by the recoiled proton angle,
$P_p(\theta_p)$, expressed as a percentage of the HMS central momentum,
$P_0$ is given as  
\begin{equation}
\label{delta_p}
{\Delta_p=\frac{P_p - P_p(\theta_p)}{P_0}\times 100.}
\end{equation}
The variance of $\Delta_p$ was found to be 0.7$\%$. A $\pm 3\sigma$ cut 
around the central peak of $\Delta_p$ was chosen for further background
suppression for the coincidence data. The spectrum of $\Delta_p$ is shown
in Fig.~\ref{Delta_p}.

%coincidence data.  


\subsection{Corrections to Event Reconstruction}

The presence of the target magnetic field affects the electron and proton
trajectories.
The standard matrix elements for $\delta$ and $\phi_{tar}$ take 
the vertical position of the beam at the target into account, hence the 
determinations of $\delta$ and of the out-of-plane angle, $\phi_{tar}$ are 
sensitive to a vertical beam position offset.  
The slow-raster system would vary the vertical position about its assumed 
average value.
The HMS optics matrix has been determined originally without the
presence of a target magnetic field. Therefore, an additional particle
transport through the target magnetic field has been added to the
existing HMS particle-tracking algorithm to account for the additional
particle deflection due to the target magnetic field. The treatment
of this additional particle transport was developed in an iterative
procedure. First, the particle track was reconstructed to the target
from the focal plane quantities by the standard HMS reconstruction
coefficients, assuming no target magnetic field but a certain vertical beam
position. Using these target coordinates, the particle track was linearly 
propagated forward to the field-free region at 100~cm from the target center 
and then transported back to the target plane through the known target magnetic
field, to determine the newly tracked vertical position. If the difference 
between the newly tracked vertical position at the target center and the 
assumed vertical position of the beam was observed then a new effective 
vertical position was assumed and the procedure was iterated until 
the difference 
between the tracked and assumed vertical positions became less than 
1 mm~\cite{142}.  

Comparisons of data and Monte Carlo simulation (MC)
%The data-to-Montecarlo simulation comparisons 
were used to determine
the target vertical and horizontal position offsets relative to the
beam center.  
In MC, events were generated at assumed positions of the target and 
transported through the target magnetic field to an imaginary plane ouside 
the field region. Then they were reconstructed back to the target using the 
standard HMS optics matrix. 
In the data, however, the events were reconstructed to the target
positions using the same HMS optics matrix without the knowledge of 
the target offsets.
The target horizontal position offset, $X_{off}$, was determined by comparison 
of data to Montecarlo simulation yields for the reconstructed horizontal
position at the target, $Y_{tar}$. 
In the single-arm data, the $ep$ invariant mass $W$ elastic peak was 
slightly correlated with $\phi_{tar}$ as in Fig.~\ref{xoff_chk} (left). 
Because both $\phi_{tar}$ and $\delta$ have first-order dependences on the 
vertical positions of the target in the reconstruction matrix element, the 
vertical beam position deviation from the target center, $Y_{off}$, can 
have effects on the reconstructed $\phi_{tar}$ as well as $\delta$ and
hence $P$. This sensitivity caused the correlation of $\phi_{tar}$ with 
the invariant mass, $W$ as seen in Fig.~\ref{xoff_chk} (left). 

%This has investigated by generating the same correlation using Monte
%Carlo simulation.   
%The X position offset determined by the Monte Carlo simulation was
%re-checked by looking at the correlation between the reconstructed
%target out-of-plane angle, $\phi_{tar}$ and the invariant mass, $W$.  
%In MC, events were generated at a given horizontal position at the
%target, transport them to an imaginary plane and then use the HMS
%optics to reconstruct back to the same position at the
%target. However, in the data, the events were reconstructed to the
%target horizontal position, $y_{tar}$ using the HMS optics matrix
%without knowing the exact event generated positions at the target. 
% If the $y_{tar}$ is not the same as the start position of the
% particle, the data will show a correlation between $\phi_{tar}$ and
% $W$.  

The same correlation can be reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation by
reconstructing the particle to a different vertical position than from
where it was generated. The Montecarlo generated correlation is shown
in Fig.~\ref{xoff_chk} (right). 
Reproduction of the $\phi_{tar}$ vs $W$ correlation in MC generates
confidence that the same correlation seen in the data are due to the
reconstruction of the particle track to the incorrect vertical target
position. Therefore, the target vertical position offsets relative to
the beam center were introduced and determined for the measured data
by data-to-Monte Carlo simulation comparisons. This has been a very suitable
method to re-check the target vertical position offsets for the
polarized target experiments.

\end{figure}
  
 Similarly, correlations of the HMS quantities $\phi_{tar}$ vs
 $\Delta_p$ and the BETA quantities, $\Delta$Y vs $Y_{BETA}$ were also
 observed in the coincidence data, as seen in Fig.~\ref{coin_corr}. 
 Since all of these correlations are related to the
 vertical position or angle, a correction of out-of-plane angle due to
 the target magnetic field was considered the best
 explanation. Subsequently, all these correlations were re-produced by
 the Monte Carlo simulation and corrected by applying an azimuthal
 angle dependence to the target magnetic field.  
% In addition, for the coincidence data, $\Delta_p$ had a dependence
% on $\phi_{tar}$ as in Figure \ref{coin_corr} (left) and  $Y_{BETA}$
% had a dependence on $\Delta Y$ as in Figure \ref{coin_corr}
% (right). Because the reconstruction matrix element, $\delta$ takes
% into account the vertical position of the beam at the target, the
% detected momentum at the HMS spectrometer, P and hence $\Delta_p$
% and out-of-plane angle, $\phi_{tar}$ sensitive to the vertical beam
% position. 
 The so-determined azimuthal angle dependence was added to the target
 field map which was finally used for the reconstruction of particle 
 tracks to the target center. 
 That changed the particles reconstructed momentum
 and, therefore, the reconstructed vertical position, which eliminated
 the above dependencies.

\subsection{Raw/ Physics Asymmetries} %done up to here
The measured double polarization raw asymmetries of the extracted
elastic events were formed by,  
%scattering of polarized electrons from a transversely polarized
%target, the beam-target asymmetry, 
\begin {equation}
%\begin {aligned}
\label {rasym}
A_{raw}=\frac{N^+-N^-}{N^++N^- }, 
%\end {aligned}
\end {equation}                            
where $N^+$ and $N^-$ are the raw elastic yields normalized by the
dead time corrected charge. They are defined by
$N^+=N^{\uparrow\uparrow} +  N^{\downarrow\downarrow}$ and
$N^-=N^{\uparrow\downarrow} +  N^{\downarrow\uparrow}$, where the
first index refers to the beam helicity and the second index refers to
the target polarization.  

The physics asymmetry,
\begin {equation}
%\begin {aligned}
\label {pasym}
A_p=\frac{A_{raw}}{P_B P_Tf} +N_c
%\end {aligned}
\end {equation}                 
was obtained by dividing the $A_{raw}$ by target and beam
polarizations, $P_T$ and $P_B$, and the dilution factor, $f$.  

The dilution factor is the ratio of the yields of scattering off free
protons to that from the entire target. The $N_c$ term is a correction
to the measured raw asymmetry to account for the quasi-elastic
scattering contribution to the polarized $^{14}N$ which was considered to
be negligible \cite{60}. 

%The dilution factor is the ratio of the yields of scattering off free
%protons to that from the entire target. The $N_c$ term is a
%correction term to the measured asymmetry to account for the
%contribution from quasi-elastic scattering off polarized $^{15}N$
%under the elastic peak. Because SANE used $^{14}NH_3$ (ammonia), the
%correction by $N_c$ for polarized $^{14}N$ was negligible \cite{60}. 

%The electron single-arm data and the coincidence data were analyzed
%separately. For the single-arm electron data, after applying a
%relative momentum acceptance cut of $-8\%$ to $+10\%$ for the HMS
%spectrometer, and particle identification cuts on the data, elastic
%events were extracted. By knowing the incoming beam energy, $E$ and
%measuring the scattered electron angle, $\theta_e$, and scattered
%electron energy, $E'$ by the HMS spectrometer, the invariant mass,
%$W$ has been calculated for the extracted elastic event. 
% \begin{equation}
%\label{wmass}
%W^2=M^2-Q^2+2M(E-E')
%\end{equation}
%where the four-momentum transfer squared, $Q^2$ is determined as;
% \begin{equation*}
%\label{eq} 
%E'=\sfrac{E}{\left[{1+\frac{2E\sin^2{\left({\frac{\theta_e}{2}}\right)}}{M}}\right]},
%\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,  
%Q^2=4EE'\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta_e}{2}\right) 
%\end{equation*}
%using elastic kinematics.

%SANE target insert was consisted of 2 cups called \emph{top} and
%\emph{bottom} as the proton target.  
The ratio of the volume taken by the ammonia crystals to the entire
target cup volume is known as the \emph{packing fraction}, which was
determined by normalizing the measured data with the simulated
yields. The different packing fractions give rise to the different
target material contributions inside the target cup. More details
about the packing fraction determination can be found in Ref.~\cite{140}.
%H. Kang's thesis \cite{140}. 
Both target cups were used during the data
taking, the packing fractions were determined on top target as
55$\pm$5$\%$ and bottom target as 60$\pm$5$\%$.  

%and therefore the different dilution factors which were determined
%for each target cup separately.  

%Figure \ref{mc}(left) shows a comparison of simulated target
%contributions with the elastic data for the bottom target.  

The dilution factor represents the fraction of polarizable material
in the beam, from which electrons can scatter. 
The SANE target was immersed in a liquid He bath, hence 
electron scattering can occur from all the materials inside the
target cup, as well as from all the materials in the beam path toward the
target cup which are H, N, He and Al. Contributions from Al arise from
the target cup lids, the 4 K shield and the refrigerator's
tailpiece. In addition to the electron scattering off from the protons
in H, the  background contributions rise from the additional target
cup materials, N, He and Al needed to estimate. A Monte Carlo
simulation was used to estimate these backgrounds in order to determine 
the dilution factor, $f$. The weighted amount of target materials inside
each target cup were calculated, taking into account the packing
fraction. The scattering yields due to H, N, He and Al
were simulated using their individual cross sections and compared with
the single-arm elastic data to estimate the backgrounds. The simulated
target contributions for the top target for the two different $\delta$
regions are shown in Fig.~\ref{trg_cont} (left column).  

%%%%

The dilution factors were calculated for both \emph{top} and
\emph{bottom} targets by taking the ratio of the difference between
the total raw yields and the Monte Carlo background yields (N+He+Al)
to the total raw yield,    
\begin{equation}
\label{dfsin}
f=\frac{Y_{data}-Y_{MC}}{Y_{data}},
\end{equation}

where $Y_{data} = N_+ + N_-$ is the total raw yield of the measured data and
$Y_{MC}$ is the total Monte Carlo background yield from N, He,
and Al. The obtained dilution factors are shown in Fig.~\ref{trg_cont} 
(middle) for the top target for two different $\delta$
regions. The dilution factor is the largest in the elastic region
where $0.91 < W < 0.97$ GeV/c$^2$.

The physics asymmetry, $A_p$, was evaluated for the selected elastic
events using Eq.~(\ref{pasym}) for average values of $P_B=73 \pm 1.5
\% $, $P_T=70 \pm 5.0\%$, and by normalizing with the dilution factor,
$f$. Figure~\ref{trg_cont} (\emph{right}) shows the physics
asymmetries for the top and bottom targets and for the two different
$\delta$ regions, as a function of $W$. The physics asymmetries were
constant in the elastic region of $0.91 < W < 0.97$ GeV/c$^2$ 
where the dilution factor is the largest, which supports that the functional
dependence of $f$ on $W$ as in Fig.~\ref{trg_cont} (middle) is accurate. 
The average physics asymmetries and uncertainties of this constant region were
determined for both targets and $\delta$ regions using an
error-weighted mean of the $W$ bins in the interval of 0.91\textless
W\textless0.97 GeV/c$^2$. The weighted average $A_p$ was obtained for
each $\delta$ region by combining the average physics asymmetries from
both top and bottom targets. The weighted average asymmetry results are shown 
in Fig.~\ref{physasym} (\emph{left}), and are listed in 
Tab.~\ref{tabasym} (\emph{left half}).

%The simulated H contents assuming the H cross section is also

%The weighted amount of H inside the target cup were calculated taking
%into account the packing fraction and used it to simulate the H

%simulated H,  
For the coincidence data, the Monte-Carlo simulation was generated using 
the known C and H cross sections. The background shape under the elastic
peak was determined by normalizing the C background to the data for
the region of $0.03 < \Delta_p < 0.08$ where the data and
the background distributions match each other.   
A comparison between the measured data and the simulated yields is
shown in Fig.~\ref{apcoin}.   
Because of low statistics, the dilution factor $f$ for the coincidence data 
was not calculated as a function of $W$ (or $\Delta_p$) as done for 
elastic single-arm data. Instead, the average dilution factor was 
determined by an integration method using the
normalized carbon MC yields and the measured data yields under the
elastic peak  in the interval of  $| \Delta_p | \textless $0.02 $(3 \sigma)$ 
and then by using Eq.~(\ref{dfsin}). The procedure was done separately for
both beam energies 5.895 GeV and 4.725 GeV. The average dilution
factors based on the integration method for the top and bottom targets
for the beam energy of 5.895 GeV were determined as
$f = 0.785 \pm 0.039$ and $0.830 \pm 0.042$, respectively. Only the
\emph{bottom} target was used for 4.725 GeV and the dilution factor
was determined as $f = 0.816 \pm 0.041$. 
%The coincidence data for the beam energy of 4.73 GeV was obtained
%only using the bottom target. Therefore, the average dilution factor
%based on the integration method for the bottom target for the beam
%energy of 4.73 GeV was determined as $f=$0.816$\pm$0.041.  
%The physics asymmetries, $A_p$ were evaluated for the coincidence
%data using Eq. (\ref{pasym}) for each dilution factors.  

The weighted average physics asymmetry and uncertainty between the
\emph{top} and \emph{bottom} targets for the beam energy of 5.895 GeV
were obtained as $A_p = 0.083 \pm 0.074$, while that for the beam
energy of 4.725 GeV resulted in $A_p = 0.248 \pm 0.138$.

\subsection{Extraction of the \boldmath $G^p_E/G^p_M$ Ratio}
 
%The beam-target asymmetry, $A_p$ for elastic electron-proton
%scattering directly relates to the proton elastic form factor ratio,
%$G_E^p/G_M^p$ for a known target spin orientation as in Equation
%\ref{asym}. Therefore, using Equation \ref{asym}, $G_E^p/G_M^p$ can
%be determined directly from $A_p$ using the formula: 
One can extract $\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ for a kown target spin orientation
from the beam-target asymmetry in Eq.~(\ref{asym}) by solving for R. 

% \begin{eqnarray}
%\label{gegm}
%\frac{G_E^p}{G_M^p}&=&-\frac{b}{2A_p}\sin \theta^* \cos \phi^*\\ 
%& & +
%\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4A_p^2}\sin^2\theta^*\cos^2\phi^*-\frac{a}{A_p}\cos
%\theta^*-c}\nonumber 
%\end{eqnarray}

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
%\label{btasym}
%A_p=\frac{-br\sin \theta^* \cos \phi^*-a\cos \theta^* }{r^2+c},
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
%where $r=G_E^p/G_M^p$, and $\theta^*$ and $\phi ^*$ are the polar and
%azimuthal-angles between the momentum transfer vector, $\vec{q}$ and
%the proton's spin vector.  
%The kinematic factors are given by,
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
%\label{btasymabc}
%&a=2 \tau \tan \frac{\theta_e}{2}\sqrt{1+\tau+(1+\tau)^2\tan^2
%\frac{\theta_e}{2}}\\ 
%&b=2 \tan \frac{\theta_e}{2}\sqrt{\tau(1+\tau)}\\
%&c=\tau+2\tau(1+\tau)\tan^2\frac{\theta_e}{2}
%\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
%with $\tau=\frac{Q^2}{4M^2}$. 

The four-momentum transfer squared, $Q^2(E, E', \theta_e)$ can be
obtained for elastic events from $\theta_e$ or $E'$ alone. 
Since $Q^2$ from $\theta_e$
is more accurate than $Q^2$ from $E'$, $Q^2$ we used the electron angle 
$\theta_e$ to calculate $Q^2$ for already selected elastic events and 
found to agree with the $Q^2$ distribution from the Monte Carlo simulation 
yields. %The difference between 
%the data and the simulated $Q^2$ distribution was obtained and t
The mean value of the $Q^2$ distribution was used to calculate $\tau$ which 
is used in the terms $a,b,c$ in Eq.~(\ref{asym}).  
The mean of the detected (or calculated using elastic kinematics of
the proton in HMS) electron scattering angle, $\theta_e$ was
determined by the $\theta_e$ distribution for the selected electrons
on single-arm (coincidence) data. The polar and azimuthal angles,
$\theta^*$ and $\phi ^*$ were calculated as
 \begin{eqnarray}
% \begin{aligned}
\label{thetastar}
\theta^*&=&\arccos (-\sin \theta_q\cos\phi_e\sin\beta+\cos\theta_q\cos
\beta) \\ 
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{phistar}
\phi^*&=&-\arctan\left(\frac{\sin \phi_e \sin \beta}{\cos \theta_q
    \cos \phi_e \sin \beta + \sin \theta_q \cos
    \beta}\right)+180^{\circ} \nonumber. 
%\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

The out-of-plane angle of the scattered electron at the target plane,
$\phi_e$ is the mean of the detected $\phi_e$ distribution for the
elastic events. The three-momentum transfer vector, $\vec{q}$ points
at an angle $\theta_q$, which is identical with the elastically
scattered proton angle, and is measured event-by-event for the
elastic kinematics of the electron (proton) in the HMS. The mean value
of the $\theta_q$ distribution was used in Eq.~(\ref{thetastar}). The
target magnetic field direction was oriented with $\beta$=$80^{\circ}$
toward the BETA detector package from the beam line direction
within the horizontal plane. The distribution of $\phi^*$ arises from the 
$\phi_e$ acceptance distribution. If $\phi_e=0$ then $\phi^*=0^{\circ}$ for
single-arm data and $\phi^* = 180^{\circ}$ for coincidence data.  

The physics asymmetries $A_p$, and the extracted proton form factor
ratios, $R=G_E^p/G_M^p$ together with the average kinematic parameters
for both single-arm and coincidence data are shown in Tab.~\ref{tabasym}.

\subsection{Systematic Error Estimation}

The systematic error of the form factor ratio $G_E^p/G_M^p$, $\Delta
(G_E^p/G_M^p)$ was determined by propagating the errors from the
experimental parameters to the physics asymmetry, $\Delta A_p$.  

The errors arising from the kinematic quantities were estimated by 
varying each quantity, one at a time by its corresponding uncertainty
($\delta E = 0.05$\% for the beam energy, $\delta P = 0.1$\% for the
central momenta, and $\delta \theta_{e} = 0.5$ mrad for the spectrometer
angle), and by propagating these errors to a Monte Carlo extracted
$G_E^p/G_M^p$ ratio. The resulting difference between the extracted
$G_E^p/G_M^p$ ratio from the value at the nominal kinematics and the
value shifted by the kinematic uncertainty was taken as the contribution
to the systematic uncertainty in the $G_E^p/G_M^p$ ratio due to that
quantity. In general, the uncertainties due to the kinematic
variables, $E, E'(= P)$ and $\theta_e$ are less than 1\%.  

Using the Jacobian of the elastic electron-proton reaction, the error
on the momentum transfer angle, $\delta \theta_q$ was obtained from
$\delta$E and the $\delta \theta_e$ and estimated as
$\delta\theta_q = 0.03^{\circ}$. In addition, by assuming an error of
the target magnetic field direction of $\delta \beta=0.1^{\circ}$, the
uncertainties of $\theta^*$ and $\phi ^*$ were estimated to be $\delta
\theta^* = 1.22$ mrad and $\delta \phi^* = 0.3$ mrad. The error of
$G_E^p/G_M^p$ from the $\delta \theta^*$ was determined as 0.54\%,
while that from the $\delta \phi ^*$ was determined as 0.01\%. 
%A proportionality constant called $\emph{calibration constant}$ is
%used to convert the known polarization at thermal equilibrium at a
%given temperature to the true polarization. The target polarization
%is based on the accuracy of this calibration constants and  
The systematic error on the target polarization was estimated as 5\%,
which constitutes the largest systematic uncertainty \cite{109}. The
error on the beam polarization measurement comes from a global error
of the M$\o$ller measurements and the error due to the fit to these
measurements. The beam polarization uncertainty during SANE was
measured as 1.5\% \cite{109}. 

For both single-arm and coincidence data sets, the dilution factors
have been determined using the comparison of data-to-Monte Carlo
simulated yields. Since the simulated yields were based on the packing
fraction, the error of 5\% on the packing fraction measurement
propagates to the dilution factor.  Therefore, the uncertainty of the
form factor ratio, $G_E^p/G_M^p$ due to the error of the dilution
factor was determined as 1.34\%. 

Single-arm data were analyzed using an extended momentum acceptance
for the region of  $10\% \textless \delta \textless 12\%$, where the
HMS optics were not well-tested. The reconstruction of the particle
tracks from this region was not well-understood. Therefore, the
uncertainty of the spectrometer optics on this region was a particular
source of systematic uncertainty for the single-arm data
\cite{147}. This has been tested with the Monte Carlo simulation. The
biggest loss of events in this higher $\delta$ region, $10\% \textless
\delta \textless 12\%$ was found to be at the HMS vacuum pipe exit. By
applying $\pm$2 mm offsets to the vacuum pipe positions on both
vertical and horizontal directions separately in MC, and taking the
standard effective solid angle change between the offset and the
nominal vacuum pipe position, the uncertainty due to higher-momentum
electron tracks hitting the edge of the vacuum pipe exit was
determined.  The resulting uncertainty due to the particle track
reconstruction and effective solid angle change was estimated as
0.68\%.  
%Also, Monte Carlo yields were normalized to data in the invariant
%mass region of 0.7\textless W\textless 0.85 GeV/c$^2$. Therefore, the
%uncertainty, 0.68\% that comes from losing events due to higher
%$\delta$ are already accounted in the dilution factors. 

Table~\ref{tabsys} summarizes non-negligible contributions to the
systematic uncertainty of the single-arm data. Each source of
systematics, the uncertainty of each quantity, and the resulting
contribution to the relative systematic uncertainty of the  $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p$ ratio (=$\mu_p R$) are shown. The relative systematic
uncertainty was obtained by summing all the individual contributions
linearly and quadratically. The linear sum represents the maximum
possible error of the measurement, which propagates to the error on
$\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ and was estimated as 9.13$\%$.   
The final error on the form factor ratio represents by the quadratic
sum and was estimated as  5.44$\%$. The polarizations of the beam and
target and the packing fraction were the dominant contributions to the
systematic uncertainty. %However, due to lack of statistics for the

\section{Results}

The results for the proton elastic form factor ratio, $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p$, determined for both single-arm and coincidence data are
shown in Tab.~\ref{tabasym}. For the single-arm data, 
the resulting form factor ratio from the
two $\delta$ regions of the HMS momentum acceptance was determined by
extrapolating both measurements to the average $Q^2$ using Kelly's
parametrization \cite{99} and then taking the weighted average of the
two form factor ratios. The resulting form factor ratio, $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p = 0.720 \pm 0.176_{stat} \pm 0.039_{sys}$ was obtained for an
average four-momentum transfer squared $Q^2=2.06$ (GeV/c)$^2$. 

The form factor ratios from the coincidence data from two beam
energies were also combined and the weighted average $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p$ was obtained at the average $Q^2=5.66$
(GeV/c)$^2$. Since the errors on the coincidence data were 
largely dominated by statistics, the systematic uncertainties  were not
explicitly studied. Instead, the systematics from single-arm data were 
applied for an estimation. The resulting form factor ratio 
for the coincidence data was obtained as $\mu_p
G_E^p/G_M^p = 0.244 \pm 0.353_{stat} \pm 0.013_{sys}$ for an average
$Q^2=5.66$ (GeV/c)$^2$.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

Measurements of the proton's elastic form factor ratio, $\mu{_p}
G{^p}_E/G{^p}_M$, from the polarization-transfer experiments at high
$Q^2$ continue to show a dramatic discrepancy with the ratio obtained 
from the traditional Rosenbluth technique in unpolarized cross section
measurements as shown in Fig~\ref{resultratio}.  
The measurement of the beam-target asymmetry in the elastic \emph{ep}
scattering is an independent, third technique to determine the proton 
form factor ratio. 
The results from this method are in full agreement with the
proton recoil polarization data, which validates the
polarization-transfer method and reaffirms the discrepancy between
Rosenbluth and polarization data with different systematics.  
Two-photon exchange (TPE) continues to be a possible explanation for the
form factor discrepancy at high $Q^2$. 
However, the discrepancy may or may not be due to TPE, and further TPE 
measurements at high $Q^2$ need to be made before a final conclusion on 
TPE can be achieved.

Since the sensitivity of the beam-target asymmetry to TPE effect is
formally the same as in the recoil-polarization, this method was expected to
show consistent results with the recoil-polarization method. Having
different systematic errors from the Rosenbluth method and the
polarization-transfer technique, by measuring $G_E/G_M$ with the
polarized target technique, the discovery of unknown or underestimated 
systematic errors in the previous measurement techniques is possible. 
 
Our result for $\mu{_p} G{^p}_E/G{^p}_M$ at $Q^2$=2.06 (GeV/c)$^2$ is 
consistent with the previous measurement of the beam-target asymmetry at 
$Q^2$=1.5 (GeV/c)$^2$~\cite{60} and agrees very well with the existing 
recoil-polarization measurements.
Our measurement did not reveal any unknown systematic difference from
the polarization-transfer method. 

The result at $Q^2$=5.66 (GeV/c)$^2$ has a larger statistical
uncertainty due to the small number of counts. As a byproduct
measurement of the SANE experiment, the precision of this result is
limited by statistics.  
However, the measurement with HMS was not under optimized conditions. 
A gas leak in HMS drift chamber during the coincidence data taking resulted
in only 40\% efficiency for elastic proton detection with the
HMS. In addition, due to a damage of the superconducting Helmholtz
coils that used to polarize the NH$_3$ target, the production
data-taking time was reduced.  
Therefore, single-arm data were taken for only about $\sim$12 hours in
total while coincidence data for elastic kinematics were taken for
only about one week for both beam energies 4.725 GeV and 5.895 GeV,
$\sim$40 hours and $\sim$155 hours, respectively. The target spin
orientation was not optimized for the measurement of $G_E/G_M$.  
Nevertheless, the obtained precision confirms the
suitability of using the beam-target asymmetry for determinations of
the $\mu_p G_E^p/G_M^p$ ratio at high $Q^2$.  
% can we add an estimate how high in Q2 we can go for 10% error and 1000h?

Under optimized conditions, it would have been possible to take at least 
four times the amount of data in the same time period, which would decrease
the error bars on both measurements by at least a factor of two. It is
hence suitable to extend the polarized-target technique to higher $Q^2$ and
achieve high precision with a dedicated experiment under optimized
conditions.
